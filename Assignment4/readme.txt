Kyle Lambert (lambert.448)
CSE 5542 - Assignment 4 - Textures
March 22, 2019

I used basic WebGL for this project. Run the 04texture-KyleLambert.html file in a browser to see 
the program. All of the code is in main.gl. There are also the fragment and vertex shaders included.

To run, you need to host a local server. I used Python 2.7 and "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" command
in the folder of my project. Then in your browser go to "localhost:8000" and click on the html file
to see the boxes. This is because the browser blocks external images from the file system due to
CORS policy.  I included screenshots in the screenshots folder if you can't get it to run.
