Kyle Lambert (lambert.448)
CSE 5542 - Assignment 2
February 15, 2019

All of my own code is in Main.js and 02viewing-KyleLambert.html. 
To run the lab, just open 02viewing-KyleLambert.html in a browser.

For this project, I used WebGL along with THREE.js to create the scene.
The scene consists of 2 Perspective Cameras, one for each eye. There is
an "infinite" plane underneath the robot as well as fog in every direction
so the area looks endless.  

After asking Prof. Chen, I used THREE.js's OrbitControls so you can move
around the scene easily. Holding Left Mouse Button allows you to rotate 
around the robot. Holding Right Mouse Button allows you to pan around 
the screen. Using the scroll wheel zooms in and out. 

For the extra credit, I made a walk animation for the robot. It walks in
place by moving its legs back and forth. Its eyebrows also change so its
expression changes from sad to mad.
