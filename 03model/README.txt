Kyle Lambert (lambert.448)
CSE 5542 - Assignment 3
March 9, 2019

All of my code is in Main.js and 03model-KyleLambert.html. 
To run the lab, just open 03model-KyleLambert.html in a browser. Then there
is a button in the upper right corner of the page where you must specify there
"grammar.txt" file. After loading the text file, then the L-system will be generated.

You can change the rules in the "grammar.txt" file but they must follow the same format.
The first line must be the number of generations.
The second line must be the angle of rotation.
The third line must be the starting symbol of the production.
Every subsequent line must be a production rule with no spaces between the symbol and '=' sign.

For example, F=FF will work but F = FF will NOT work, so you must follow the format correctly.
