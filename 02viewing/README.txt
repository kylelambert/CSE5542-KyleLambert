For this project, I used WebGL along with THREE.js to create the robot.
Initially I created each object as specified in the instructions.
The robot is made of these objects translated, rotated, and scaled.

I also used THREE.js's OrbitControls so you can rotate/pan around the robot 
with the mouse and zoom in and out.

For extra credit, I used torus primitives on the robot's ears and mouth.
